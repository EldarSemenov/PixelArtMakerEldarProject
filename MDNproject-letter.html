    <h2><strong>Re:Eileen Dover university application</strong></h2>
    <p>
        Dear Eileen,<br>
        Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University
        of Awesome' science faculty to study as part <br>
        of your PhD next year. I will answer questions one by one, 
        in the following sections.
    </p>
    <h3>Starting dates</h3>
    <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting with us at any time, 
        however it would suit us better if you <br>
        could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates 
        for each one are as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
        <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
        <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which 
        start date you would prefer.
    </p>
    <p>You can find more information about 
        <a href="www.university.com">important university dates</a>
         on our website.
    </p>
    <h3>Subjects of study</h3>
    <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty
        open-minded research facility - as long as the subjects 
        fall <br> somewhere in the realm of science and technology. 
        You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, 
        and just <br>  the kind of person we'd like to have on our team.
        Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most 
        intrigued <br> by are as follows, in order of priority:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health 
         benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
        <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers
             at temperatures exceeding 30&#176;C (86&#176;F), when the<br> 
             audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> 
             increasing to 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>.) 
        </li> 
        <li><abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>audience
         and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing
          musical scores. 
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        So please can you provide more information on each of these 
        subjects, including how long you'd expect the <br>
        research to take, required staff and other resources, 
        and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
    </p>
    <h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>
    <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, 
        I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, <br>
        my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
        <dd>A little known but <em>very</em> influential dance
        back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around<br>
        in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".
        </dd>
        <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
        <dd>
            Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting
             warm, they used to practise this dance, which <br>
             involved  huddling close together in a circle on the floor, 
             and shuffling their bodies around this dance inspired <br>
             modern styles such as Twerking.
        </dd>
        <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
        <dd>
            An interesting example of historic misinformation, English 
            explorers in the 1960s belived to have <br>
            discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", 
            stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants <br>
            of Northern Alasks and Canada. Later on however it was 
            discovered that they were just moving like this <br>
            because they were really cold.
        </dd>
